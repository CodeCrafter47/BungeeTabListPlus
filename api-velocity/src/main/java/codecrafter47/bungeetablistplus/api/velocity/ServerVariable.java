 * Base class for creating custom Variables bound to a server.
 * <p>
 * To create a custom (per server) Variable you need to create a subclass of this class
 * and register an instance of it with {@link BungeeTabListPlusAPI#registerVariable}
 * <p>
 * After registration the variable can be used in the config file in several ways:
 * Use {@code ${viewer server <name>}} to resolve the variable for the server of the
 * player looking at the tab list.
 * Use {@code ${player server <name>}} to resolve the variable for the server of a
 * player displayed on the tab list, this one can only be used inside the playerComponent.
 * Use {@code ${server <name>}} to resolve the variable for a particular server inside the
 * serverHeader option of the players by server component.
 * Use {@code ${server:<serverName> <name>}} to resolve the variable for a specific server.
